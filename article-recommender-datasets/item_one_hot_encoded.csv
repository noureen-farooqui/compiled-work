0,"Imagine this: You're an intelligent senior level leader in your company. But people think you're dumb.

Your feedback ratings are extremely poor.

Why?

Because you use handwritten letters (delivered by post) to communicate critical information with the whole company instead of using email.😱

You think that it's YOUR STYLE OF OPERATION and you're still conveying the message anyway!🤯

Do you think people will still enjoy working with you irrespective of how knowledgeable you are in your domain?

Oftentimes, When I work with senior professionals, I hear them say:

🚩""This is my style of working""

🚩""I've been doing this for years and I don't want to change this""

🚩""I'm the leader, my team should adjust""

🚩""I've done it this way far too long and it's difficult to change that now, so I'll not work on changing it. I'll double down on what I'm doing""

As senior professionals, you need to understand that the technology landscape is changing faster than ever!

You HAVE to keep up. It's no longer a choice, but a necessity❗️

Are you being like the guy with the letters instead of email because you refuse you change?📝

Then you've to know that you're replaceable at work.💼

Would YOU be willing to hire a senior leader who is living in a world that existed 15 years ago and refuses to change?

You know the answer. Then why be your own roadblock?

7,"Yesterday, we had a guest session by Ankur Warikoo for my tiny homegrown cohort-based course, Summit 21.

Of course, I asked him knowing in my head he’ll say no.

Why would somebody who talks to major companies come to my cohort? Why would somebody so busy say yes to me?

When I asked him, there wasn’t a followed up discussion. 

He said yes in minutes :)

So we had a fun-filled call with 33 students from across India, the U.S., England, Ireland, Singapore, Canada, and France. 

They've been a part of one of my Summit 21 cohorts in the past 18 months that I’ve been running it.

We spoke about
• an offbeat career path as a parent (since most of my students have kids)
• how to distraction-proof yourself in today's world
• making a living by following your bliss
• writing online + ideation + process
• and so much more... :)

One of our attendees made five pages of notes! Imagine, a LinkedIn post and a few bullets can't do justice to an hour-long value-packed session.

My biggest takeaways were:
• having a partner who's in sync with you can change everything
• use money to make life more comfortable so you can focus
• we don't have as much to lose as we think we do
• what would you rather be, if not humble?
• it's important to live, you'll die anyway

But again, these points do absolutely zero justice to how entertaining and inspiring it was to just watch him talk.

Also - when you want something, ask for it. The worst answer is only no. But what if it’s a yes? I learnt this from my experience of mustering a few seconds of courage to send him that text asking him to be a part of this, haha.

Today, I'm sinking in the exceptional response I've got from my students but also looking back to think that Summit 21 has come a long way. 

What I started as a fun experiment to see if what I teach actually works, is running its eighth full cohort attracting a global audience. I still have the feeling of not knowing how long it'll last.

But instead of focusing on that, I'm just going to *live* and chill out, as Warikoo says :)",1,0,0,0,0
8,"During the starting of my career, I was consistently advised by my family and friends to 'network' well in the office.

And rightly so - networking can help you gain recognition at your workplace.

However, as an introvert, I often found it difficult to make small talks or network with my senior bosses/ colleagues.

But, I knew that I was a hard worker and my strong suit was research.

Hence, I decided to double down on that strength.

I would:
- do extensive research, 
- prepare exhaustive notes, and 
- add relevant pointers to project reports.

This helped me distinguish myself from my peers.

I eventually became the go-to person for any kind of project detailing and presentation. 

And, the senior bosses started noticing my efforts, and appreciated the value addition.

**********
This is what I learnt -

Networking is an important skill for getting noticed at the workplace, and progressing further in your career.

However, contrary to the popular opinion, networking can only get you so far.

The best way to earn recognition at work? - Be good at what you do.

Specifically, aim to become the expert or go-to person on the team when it comes to a particular task or issue.

Step up whenever a related need arises. 

Your boss and your coworkers will surely notice. And you wouldn't have to 'network' your way to the top.",1,0,0,0,0

11,"How can we create a fulfilling career path that encourages our employees to embark on a growth journey within our organisation?

Back in the day, it was common for individuals to work for the same organisation for a good 15 to 20 years, perhaps even until retirement. But nowadays, it seems like people are sprinting from one opportunity to the next, barely sticking around for more than a couple of years.
At Suburban Diagnostics, we take pride in the fact that we have employees who have been with us for more than a decade.

First and foremost, it's important to provide opportunities for continuous learning and development. By offering training programs, mentorship opportunities, and access to industry resources, we empower our employees to hone their skills and expand their knowledge base.

Creating a career path also involves providing clear goals and opportunities for advancement. Our employees are encouraged to set personal and professional goals, and we work together to map out a path to achieve them. By aligning their aspirations with the organisation's vision, we enable our employees to see how their growth journey fits into the bigger picture. 

When employees feel valued and connected, they are more likely to envision a long-term future with us.

Personally, I enjoy having lunch with my teammates as it allows me to foster stronger connections with them. This provides a less intimidating environment, allowing for more open conversations and understanding personal aspirations.

How do you envision a fulfilling career path within an organisation? What factors do you consider essential for fostering long-term commitment and growth? I'm eager to hear your thoughts and experiences.

16,"WORKLIFE BALANCE is a MYTH...

While I was conducting my Skill Up Workshop, there were some people who wants to switch their jobs because there is no work life balance in the existing organisation.

I personally believe there is no such thing as WorkLife Balance.

When we start doing what we really enjoy, or
When we know the purpose behind what we are doing is strong enough, or
When we get the desired results from our work,
We never ask for a work life balance. 

Its a natural process. 

On the other hand, when we start cribbing about the work and its not solving the purpose anymore, we start making excuses that we don't get time for our family and our personal life.

Here are a few things which might eliminate the WorkLife Balance concept -

[1] Focus on being more productive

You will stop wasting your time on things that doesn't really matter.

[2] Identify your areas of interest and try to find the career opportunities around that.

It will require a bit of introspection & personal SWOT analysis.

[3] Set your priority list without regrets

I have seen a lot of people doing this - they do things which they know are important and yet not able to accept that reality happily. 

Your priority list should be your CHOICE and not COMPULSION.

[4] WorkLife Balance is not really a lifestyle, its a mindset

I hope this will help you have a different outlook at the concept of WorkLife Balance and help you overcome this mental loop.

It's looks very lucrative to make few thousands extra every month by freelancing at your initial career. But it can impede your career growth at later stages because of below reasons.

1. Most of the time when your #freelancing you don't learn new things you will use existing tech stack knowledge.

2. Most of the time you don't focus for quality, ex: unit testing, integration testing, code coverage etc.

3. You will burn out yourself by working day and night where payment is not made ontime.

Instead use initial career extra time to master the tech that your working on. Understand the problem in-depth and solve it. If you can switch to a good company the hike you receive will be much higher than what you can earn through freelancing.

Varnim worked with us last year through our complete application packages.

Over 6 long-drawn months, we helped him
- build out his story,
- identify his strengths and weaknesses, and accordingly find the best-fit schools
- find a way to tell his story in his own unique way, and
- practice multiple mock interviews to optimize his chances!

But it was not all hunky-dory.
- He struggled with getting his test scores. Took him multiple attempts
- A 1-year career gap for UPSC prep
- Chances of being characterised as just another Indian Male Engineer candidate

We did what we could - shoot our best shots. Some worked, some didn't.

I assume that will be ""everyone""! 😉

My takeaways from this rich interview are:

1) Marketing is the language of connecting #products to #people. 🦄 Thinking as a marketer is one of the most undervalued skills of product managers and leaders. Those product people who know how to think about not only what to #build, but how to sell it are exceptions and highly valued.

2) To foster the culture of #feedback & #growth, you need to celebrate such behaviors, particularly as a #seniorleader. 🎆 Next time someone provides you feedback, recognize that person in your team meeting and appreciate them for helping you grow. This will empower the team to provide feedback for you and each other.

3) Shadow of your #superpower is a thing! 🎭 An individual's weaknesses may be masked by their superpowers. In order to grow in your career you need to identify those weaknesses and address them.

4) One thing everyone should do is to ensure your work today and the career decisions you make serve your ""skip job"" -- the next role(s) you aim to have. 🚀 Sit down and write that story (Amazon press release format). If the story doesn't sound exciting, work on the gaps and re-write your story.

55,"In a novel approach that could help generate hydrogen from seawater, researchers at #iitmadras have developed critical components to electrolyze seawater that can be powered by solar energy. The electrolyser has been developed using alkaline seawater in place of pure or fresh water. The researchers used carbon-based support material for the electrodes instead of metals, thus completely eliminating the possibility of corrosion. They also designed and developed transition metal-based catalysts that can catalyse both oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions. The catalysts help speed up the production of hydrogen and oxygen from seawater, while the carbon-based electrodes are resistant to corrosion in seawater.

58,"Have you ever wondered, how magnificently these AI like Bard AI, ChatGPT GIVE SUCH INTUITIVE AND HUMANE ANSWERS, well don’t be overwhelmed because THE DEVELOPERS DON'T KNOW EITHER?
 In a recent interview with Sunder Pichai, CEO of Google, Alphabet admitted that even the Bard AI is a Black box. 
 🏹Now what is “Blackbox”, Blackbox refers to a self-learning system that can learn, predict and filter operations, even beyond the understanding of its developers. This is the case with Instagram and YouTube algorithms shown in ""The Social Dilemma"". AI experts believe that AI's extensive use in almost every industry may make humanity lose the race to AI. Traditionally, black box was described as a factory where an input (potato) is processed, and the output (potato chips) is obtained.
But I believe it is obsolete to explain what's happening behind the doors because it doesn't explain the sheer magnitude of data operations and the outcomes.
 🏹The more appropriate would be “Imagine sowing a seed as the input in soil, which serves as Blackbox in this case. After millions of operations during the processing stage, the seed grows into a massive tree (output)”, depicting the incredible improvement that AI can achieve.
     According to several AI researchers 50% of AI. researchers believe there's a 10% or greater chance that humans go extinct from our inability to control AI.
“The way these companies are progressing provides great asymmetric power to these big tech companies against common people, widening at a rate that is never seen before. They can predict with 95% accuracy that you're going to quit your job according to an IBM study. They can predict your micro expressions on your face better than a human being.”
Tristan Harris, Technology ethicist and founder of Center of Humane Technology.
 🏹AI has the potential to solve problems that are unsolvable and benefit humanity, however it's important to recognize the need for ethical principles to guide its development. The widespread use of AI in various industries requires a responsible approach that prioritises ethical considerations over market share. We are at the critical moment where the responsible application of AI is essential to prevent catastrophic consequences for society. Unlike nuclear energy, which has limitations on its growth, AI is advancing exponentially, highlighting the need for a robust ethical framework to ensure its development does not cause permanent damage.
 🏹I believe that it all starts with working together to make AI safe for the world by having an open, honest discussion about AI ethics.
So how do we regulate AI development and ensure that it's used for the betterment of humanity, rather than for our own destruction?

But when you have a dream, it doesn't often come at you screaming in your face, ""This is who you are, this is what you must be for the rest of your life."" Sometimes a dream almost whispers. And I've always said to my kids, the hardest thing to listen toâ€”your instincts, your human personal intuitionâ€”always whispers; it never shouts. Very hard to hear. So you have to every day of your lives be ready to hear what whispers in your ear; it very rarely shouts. And if you can listen to the whisper, and if it tickles your heart, and it's something you think you want to do for the rest of your life, then that is going to be what you do for the rest of your life, and we will benefit from everything you do."" - Steven Spielberg  #passion   #listentothewhispers   #findyourwhy   #startwithwhy   #liveyourwhy

Because all the wisdom in the world is meaningless without application.   When you freely share your wisdom, you provide value to others. Your observations enrich their lives. You help them think about their situations in an entirely new light and encourage possibilities to emerge.

Your CV is, in today’s hypercompetitive world, either your biggest asset or your biggest weakness. Ever heard of the saying that first impressions are made within the first 3 seconds ? Same goes for the CV, except that impression is made before they even meet you.

Your CV, beyond what you have done professionally, communicates a lot much more about you:
⚙️ How do you summarize, structure, and condense information about your past experiences 
🧠 How do you reference past highlights, how do you present information
✍️ How rigorous are you in your writing, how attentive are you to detail (indents, fonts, double spacing, errors)
 And so much more

We know what CV’s have gotten accepted into the best Business Schools (HEC/LBS/INSEAD...), Consulting Firms (McKinsey/BCG...) & Investment Banks (GS/MS/Barclays...), and how to replicate the formula successfully for our students.
