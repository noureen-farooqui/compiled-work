"Here’s my take on how Apple Vision Pro or moreover AR Headsets will improve the way we work as a designer.

With the introduction of the dual-chip Apple Vision Pro, we will soon have the capability to seamlessly merge our real-life experiences with our devices using spatial computing.

Here’s a Scenario - You're a designer looking for inspiration for a UX Design Principle Poster heading. You scan your bookshelf with your awesome AR/VR headset and boom! You instantly know which book you're reading and what chapter you're on. Cool, right?

You flip through the pages, stumble upon some highlighted sections, and there you see the design principle which you have been looking for!You select that text, drag and drop it directly to Figma and your poster is ready! 

Catch these folks who are constantly sharing new ideas, prototypes and inspired me to turn my thoughts into reality.
